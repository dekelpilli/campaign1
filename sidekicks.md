## Sidekicks

### Rules
* Party cannot have more than sidekick at once, but their starting humanoid sidekick is always waiting at home in case another one dies.
* Humanoid sidekicks get the full benefit of any gear they are given, whereas non-humanoid sidekicks on gain magical benefits (so non-magical weapons do nothing, no AC gained, etc).
* Non-default sidekick's CRs cannot be so high that it is alone enough for a Deadly encounter for a normal party of those levels.
    * This might get changed to "Hard" if it seems that these are stronger than players
* Non-default sidekicks join at the party's average level, meaning they gain nothing from those previous levels.
This should balance out with the creature CRs being higher.
* Non-default sidekick's interaction with extra attack:
    * Extra attack means that, as an action, the sidekick can do any attack twice, even if it usually can only be done once per round
    * Extra attack cannot be used with multiattack in the same turn
    * This is intentionally worse as these should be replaced as the party progresses, while the default one levels with them
* For simplicity, once the sidekick is on their side (animal handling/persuasion), they will stay loyal unless the party does something
specifically against them.
