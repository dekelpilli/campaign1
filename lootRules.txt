Amulets:
    As a bonus action, you can transform into the creature contained in the amulet, but with a fifth of the hit points. You can stay in this form for up to a minute, or until you lose all of the creature's hit points. You may also exit the form at will.
    If your transformation ended due to losing hit points, you cannot transform again until you complete a long rest. Otherwise, you cannot transform again until you complete a short rest.
    While in this form, you retain all magical bonuses from your gear.
    Amulets are created with a certain CR capacity. You can combine multiple amulets to create an amulet with a higher CR capacity (resulting amulet's CR is the highest CR whose XP is lower than the sum of the given amulet CR XPs)
    You can pay 10 * CR gold to replace the creature in an amulet

Prayer Stones:
    You can use any prayer stone to pray to any Deity, but when using the appropriate prayer stone, you get the option of skipping a step

Wands:
    Local wand bonuses apply to cantrips
    While using a wand, you may choose to make cantrip spells with a spell save DC as spell attacks

Moving mods:
    Between any weapon and any weapon
    Between rings
    Between any armour and any armour

Rings:
    Maximum of 2 mods (if using orb of creation, new formula for mods is simply `min(2, disadvantaged_1d4)`

Artifacts:
    All artifacts are "relics". Instead of getting these when completing a quest for them, artifacts related to a specific personality are unlocked at a certain quest state.
    Artifacts can only be attuned to one person (old attunements need to be let go, but artifacts are found without attunements). Attunements simply provide a free level up (1 -> 2).
    Last artifact level (10) is a choice of level (new mod from list of mods available on artifact, upgrade existing mod of choice, new random mod)
