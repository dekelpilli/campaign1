Amulets:
    As a bonus action, you can transform into the creature contained in the amulet, but with a fifth of the hit points. You can stay in this form for up to a minute, or until you lose all of the creature's hit points. You may also exit the form at will.
    If your transformation ended due to losing hit points, you cannot transform again until you complete a long rest. Otherwise, you cannot transform again until you complete a short rest.
    While in this form, you retain all magical bonuses from your gear.
    Amulets are created with a certain CR capacity. You can combine multiple amulets to create an amulet with a higher CR capacity (resulting amulet's CR is the highest CR whose XP is lower than the sum of the given amulet CR XPs)
